This endpoint is used to place a win in the game.

Every time player wins, or round ended without a win (in this case amount is 0),
we send a request to this endpoint and wait for the answer. Wait time is 5 seconds.

After timeout or any error this request will be retrying in the background until we receive 200(OK) response.
