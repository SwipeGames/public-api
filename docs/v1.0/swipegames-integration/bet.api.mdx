This endpoint is used to place a bet in the game.
Every time player places a bet, we send a request to this endpoint and wait for the answer (**sync request**).

Please make sure that this endpoint responds as quickly as possible,
so player's experience is not affected.

In case we receive not 200 (OK) response or 5 seconds timeout we will send following `refund request.
